Moving beyond static design to dynamic, event-driven automation. This turns ServerKit into a powerful automation hub.

- [x] **Visual Workflow Builder:** Node-based canvas with drag-and-drop nodes, connection validation, and config panels

- [x] **Notification Templating:** Message placeholder substitution (`${node_id.stdout}`, `{{workflow_name}}`) in notification nodes
- [x] **Execution Timeouts:** Configurable timeout per node (1–3600s) to prevent hung workflows
- [x] **Retry on Failure:** Configurable retry count (0–5) and delay per node
- [x] **Circular Dependency Detection:** Kahn's algorithm validates graph on save and before execution
