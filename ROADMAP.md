# Upcoming Development

The phases below are ordered by priority. Higher phases ship first.

---

## Phase 23: Advanced Workflow & Automation Engine (NEW)

**Priority: Critical**

Moving beyond static design to dynamic, event-driven automation. This turns ServerKit into a powerful automation hub.

- [x] **Event Triggers:** Run workflows on Git push, health check failure, high CPU usage, or Webhook receipt.
- [x] **Cron Integration:** Schedule workflows to run on recurring intervals (e.g., "Every Sunday at 2 AM, backup all DBs and rotate logs").
- [x] **Cross-Server Actions:** "When Server A's database is backed up, sync it to Server B and notify Discord."
- [x] **Logic Nodes:** If/Else conditions, loops, and custom Python/Shell script execution nodes.
- [x] **State Machine:** Track workflow execution history, retries on failure, and execution logs.
- [x] **Global Variables:** Pass data between workflow steps (e.g., take the output of a build step and pass it to a deployment step).

---

## Phase 24: Customizable Sidebar & Dashboard Views (Completed)

**Priority: High**

Let users personalize what they see. Not everyone runs email servers or manages Docker — the sidebar should adapt to each user's needs.

- [x] Sidebar configuration page in Settings
- [x] Preset view profiles (Full, Web Hosting, Email Admin, Docker/DevOps, Minimal)
- [x] Custom view builder — toggle individual sidebar items on/off
- [x] Per-user preference storage (saved to user profile)

---

## Phase 25: Agent Fleet Management (Planned)

**Priority: High**

Level up agent management from "connect and monitor" to full fleet control.

- [ ] Agent version tracking and compatibility matrix (panel version ↔ agent version)
- [ ] Push agent upgrades from the panel (single server or fleet-wide rollout)
- [ ] Staged rollout support — upgrade agents in batches with health checks between waves
- [ ] Agent health dashboard — connection uptime, heartbeat latency, command success rate per agent
- [ ] Auto-discovery of new servers on the local network (mDNS/broadcast scan)
- [ ] Agent registration approval workflow (admin must approve before agent joins fleet)
- [ ] Bulk agent operations — restart, upgrade, rotate keys across selected servers
- [ ] Agent changelog and release notes visible in UI
- [ ] Offline agent command queue — persist commands and deliver when agent reconnects
- [ ] Command retry with configurable backoff for failed/timed-out operations
- [ ] Agent connection diagnostics — test connectivity, latency, firewall check from panel

---

## Phase 26: Cross-Server Monitoring Dashboard (Planned)

**Priority: High**

Fleet-wide visibility — see everything at a glance and catch problems early.

- [ ] Fleet overview dashboard — heatmap of all servers by CPU/memory/disk usage
- [ ] Server comparison charts — overlay metrics from multiple servers on one graph
- [ ] Per-server alert thresholds (CPU > 80% for 5 min → warning, > 95% → critical)
- [ ] Anomaly detection — automatic baseline learning, alert on deviations
- [ ] Custom metric dashboards — drag-and-drop widgets, save layouts per user
- [ ] Metric correlation view — spot relationships between metrics across servers
- [ ] Capacity forecasting — trend-based predictions (disk full in X days, memory growth rate)
- [ ] Metrics export — Prometheus endpoint (`/metrics`), CSV download, JSON API
- [ ] Grafana integration guide and pre-built dashboard templates
- [ ] Fleet-wide search — find which server is running a specific container, service, or port

---

## Phase 27: Agent Plugin System (Planned)

**Priority: High**

Make the agent extensible — let users add custom capabilities without modifying agent core. This is the foundation for future integrations (Android device farms, IoT fleets, custom hardware monitoring, etc.).

### Plugin Architecture
- [ ] Plugin specification — standard interface (init, healthcheck, metrics, commands)
- [ ] Plugin manifest format (YAML/JSON) — name, version, dependencies, capabilities, permissions
- [ ] Plugin lifecycle management — install, enable, disable, uninstall, upgrade
- [ ] Plugin isolation — each plugin runs in its own process/sandbox with resource limits
- [ ] Plugin communication — standardized IPC between plugin and agent core

### Plugin Capabilities
- [ ] Custom metrics reporters — plugins can push arbitrary metrics to the panel
- [ ] Custom health checks — plugins define checks that feed into the status system
- [ ] Custom commands — plugins register new command types the panel can invoke
- [ ] Scheduled tasks — plugins can register periodic jobs (cron-like)
- [ ] Event hooks — plugins can react to agent events (connect, disconnect, command, alert)

---

## Phase 28: Server Templates & Config Sync (Planned)

**Priority: Medium**

Define what a server should look like, apply it, and detect when it drifts.

- [ ] Server template builder — define expected state (packages, services, firewall rules, users, files)
- [ ] Template library — save and reuse templates (e.g., "Web Server", "Database Server", "Mail Server")
- [ ] Apply template to server — install packages, configure services, set firewall rules via agent
- [ ] Config drift detection — periodic comparison of actual vs. expected state
- [ ] Drift report UI — visual diff showing what changed and when
- [ ] Auto-remediation option — automatically fix drift back to template (with approval toggle)
- [ ] Template versioning — track changes to templates over time
- [ ] Template inheritance — base template + role-specific overrides
- [ ] Bulk apply — roll out template changes across server groups
- [ ] Compliance dashboard — percentage of fleet in compliance per template

---

## Phase 29: Multi-Tenancy & Workspaces (Planned)

**Priority: Medium**

Isolate servers by team, client, or project. Essential for agencies, MSPs, and larger teams.

- [ ] Workspace model — isolated container for servers, users, and settings
- [ ] Workspace CRUD — create, rename, archive workspaces
- [ ] Server assignment — each server belongs to exactly one workspace
- [ ] User workspace membership — users can belong to multiple workspaces with different roles
- [ ] Workspace switching — quick-switch dropdown in the header
- [ ] Per-workspace settings — notification preferences, default templates, branding
- [ ] Workspace-scoped API keys — API keys restricted to a single workspace
- [ ] Cross-workspace admin view — super-admin can see all workspaces and usage
- [ ] Workspace usage quotas — limit servers, users, or API calls per workspace
- [ ] Workspace billing integration — track resource usage per workspace for invoicing

---

## Phase 30: Advanced SSL Features (Planned)

**Priority: Medium**

- [x] Certificate expiry monitoring
- [ ] Wildcard SSL certificates via DNS-01 challenge
- [ ] Multi-domain certificates (SAN)
- [ ] Custom certificate upload (key + cert + chain)

- [ ] Route53 API integration
- [ ] DigitalOcean DNS integration
- [ ] DNS propagation checker (query multiple nameservers)
- [ ] Auto-generate recommended records for hosted services (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, MX)
- [ ] DNS template presets (e.g., "standard web hosting", "email hosting")
- [ ] Bulk record import/export (BIND zone file format)

---

## Phase 32: Nginx Advanced Configuration (Planned)

**Priority: Medium**

Go beyond basic virtual hosts — full reverse proxy and performance configuration.

- [ ] Visual reverse proxy rule builder (upstream servers, load balancing methods)
- [ ] Load balancing configuration (round-robin, least connections, IP hash)
- [ ] Caching rules editor (proxy cache zones, TTLs, cache bypass rules)
- [ ] Rate limiting at proxy level (per-IP, per-route)
- [ ] Custom location block editor with syntax validation
- [ ] Header manipulation (add/remove/modify request/response headers)
- [ ] Nginx config syntax check before applying changes
- [ ] Config diff preview before saving
- [ ] Access/error log viewer per virtual host
